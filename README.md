# Learning to visualize audio

In this lesson, we will use a few simple libraries to visualize the audio signal
coming from your microphone in different ways. 

In the end, we will build a simple guitar tuner that can tell you what the dominant
frequency your microphone is hearing at the moment.

1. [Part 1 - setting up a GUI window and graphing interface with PySimpleGUI](blob/master/parts/1_setup.py)
2. Part 2 - how a microphone works, connecting a microphone with Python.
3. Part 3 - displaying a waveform.
4. Part 4 - building a simple spectrum analyzer.
5. Part 5 - displaying the dominant frequency.
